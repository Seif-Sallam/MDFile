# Markdown File Creator

This is a simple library to create a markdown file in an easy way that is friendly to use and can be extended to be used in other projects. The main intention in this library is to make it easier to write results of experiments in an easy way.

It is a text file at the end of the day so you can do whatever you want with it.
